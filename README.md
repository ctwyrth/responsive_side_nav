# responsive_side_nav

This is another CSS & Javascript coding project done using a tutorial as reference. My version treats the active menu as an overlay as opposed to a two column push. I initially tried to use a linear gradient to achieve the overlay affect, but ultimately using an opacity on the background of the active sidebar element resulted in the best visual effect.
