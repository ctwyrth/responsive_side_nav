# responsive_side_nav

This is another CSS & Javascript coding project done using a tutorial as reference. My version treats the active menu as an overlay as opposed to a two column push. I initially tried to use a linear gradient to achieve the overlay affect, but ultimately using an opacity on the background of the active sidebar element resulted in the best visual effect.

A bit of a side reason for these projects is to test the development enivronment for the new web browser, Arc, from [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company). So far I've been impressed by the browser's functionality. Its user experience is top notch, but the use paradigm is a little confusing... most probably because its a bit of a shift from what I've been doing for the last 20+ YEARS.

UPDATE: Modified the HTML to make use of semantic tags, added lorem ipsum text to make the over lay a little more obvious, and tweaked miscellaneous sizes, paddings and margins.
